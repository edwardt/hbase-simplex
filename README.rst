A project with the ambition to run Simplex on top of HBase. Basically, the ambitions are:

* Have a tool for loading a model into an HBase representation
* Have map-reduce jobs for the required matrix operations
* Have an implementation of Simplex expressed in terms of these basic
  matrix operations
* Have the ability to export the solution in a sensible way

Extra points if we implement additional heuristics.
